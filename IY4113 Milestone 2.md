### Algorithm Design

### Research (minimum of 1 required, preferably 2)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Research No.1

Name of program: [Bus-Ticket-Reservation-System](https://github.com/shubhamrasam/Bus-Ticket-Reservation-System)

Reference with url link: [GitHub - shubhamrasam/Bus-Ticket-Reservation-System: Bus Ticket Reservation System is a Java application created to simplify the Bus Booking system](https://github.com/shubhamrasam/Bus-Ticket-Reservation-System)

What it does well (2-3 features that work effectively): Loop for the main menu ensures the program does not close after just one action. It seperates the user and admin, making the code easily organized even though it is a single user program.

What it does poorly (at least 1 feature): Relies heavily on MySQL database.

Key design ideas you could reuse (e.g., layout, navigation, input/output, program structure): Uses "switch" inside the loop to handle user's choices. The designing pattern is also clean.

#### Research No.2

Name of program: Railway Reservation System

Reference (link):[GitHub - SANJAIKUMAR-28/RailwayReservationSystem: A Console based railway reservation application using C++ OOPS.](https://github.com/SANJAIKUMAR-28/RailwayReservationSystem) 

What it does well (2-3 features that work effectively): This system treats every train number, name and age as a object. Similar to my program's "remove journey" and "recalculate total", it uses the ticket ID to remove reservations and updates the available seats instantly.

What it does poorly (at least 1 feature): User feedback is somewhat vague or too general. Instead of clear messages of the error it just outputs "invalid".

Key design ideas you could reuse (e.g., layout, navigation, input/output, program structure): This program assigns unique ID (PNR) number to every booking. Printing receipt layout is clear and easily readable.

### Updated Gantt Chart

### Diary Entries

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

22/01/2026 - Diary Entry 3 – System Design
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I chose a flowchart for my system design as I am familiar with it from previous modules. I tried researching the flowcharts of similar programs, but I could not find any results. So, I reviewed my own flowchart to refresh my understanding. After the flowchart, I started working on the JSP diagram, which turned out to be easier than expected. However, I am unsure whether my work is fully correct.

In general, there were no major difficulties except for my mental well-being.

## 24/01/2026 - Diary Entry 4 – Research and Gantt chart

Today, I worked on the research. Instead of doing just one research, I opted to do two, which could be even more useful for this program’s future. I searched through GitHub for similar projects and found two results that meet my expectations. Then I quickly updated my Gantt chart based on the previous feedback, adding the fourth week and final submission deadlines.

Doing the research and finding similar programs was quite an obstacle for me, as I am unfamiliar with GitHub.  Especially on showing the interface part, which is where I struggled the most.
